# Website
Legacy-Leaders website

## Sandbox copy

The `home/` directory contains a full duplicate of the production landing page so you can preview changes at `https://jonathantari.github.io/website/home/` without touching the root `index.html`. Keep `home/index.html` in sync with the root file (updating relative asset paths as needed) when you make changes.
